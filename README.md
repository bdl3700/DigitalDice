# DigitalDice

#### Purpose
The point of this piece of software is to provide a simple set of digital RPG dice. It enables the use of all standard RPG dice (those used for games such as DnD), that is to say dice with 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, & 20 sides and a second 10 sided dice known as a percentile die. 

#### Features
- As expected from a dice software the output of any given roll is randomized.
- The software constantly displays a list of constantly active Dice.
- A convenient display of the results from the most recent roll of the dice.
- Keybindings for all functions

#### KeyBindings
Each listed does exactly what the corresponding button in the GUI does.
- 4 -> D4 = Adds a D4 to the active Dice list
- 6 -> D6 = Adds a D6 to the active Dice list
- 8 -> D8 = Adds a D8 to the active Dice list
- 9 -> D10 = Adds a D10 to the active Dice list
- 0 -> D10p = Adds a percentile die to the active Dice list
- 1 -> D12 = Adds a D12 to the active Dice list
- 2 -> D20 = Adds a D20 to the active Dice list


- Backspace -> Clear Dice = Clears the active Dice list
- Delete -> Clear Dice = Clears the active Dice list
- \ (Backslash) -> Quick D20 = Rolls a quick D20 leaving the active Dice untouched
- . (Period) -> Quick D20 = Rolls a quick D20 leaving the active Dice untouched
- Enter -> Roll = Rolls the active Dice
